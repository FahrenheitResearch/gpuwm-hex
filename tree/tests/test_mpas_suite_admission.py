"""The MPAS route is priced from the run's own suite where that suite has measured whole runs.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS (hex 0.5.0, 2026-11-09): the 30 km RRFS hrrrv5 globe was priced from the
convection_permitting curve scaled by 59/55 levels.  One card: 72,596 MiB asked, 86,834 MiB held.  Two cards: 46,820
MiB asked per card, 65,810 held.  Four cards: 26,329 asked, 38,445 held.  A card with less free than the run needs
was admitted and the forecast would have run out of memory after its inputs were built.
