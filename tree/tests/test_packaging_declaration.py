    THE ASYMMETRY, and it is the whole point of this test's shape.  The two
    directives fail in opposite ways:

    * an `include` that names nothing PACKS nothing, and every document
      linking to that path then points at a file the reader does not have.
      That has already happened here -- `include evidence/EVIDENCE.md` named
      a file this tree did not carry, so `docs/source-matrix.md`'s link into
      it was dead in every sdist built from this tree.
    * an `exclude` that names nothing LEAKS nothing.  Absence is the
      strongest form the exclusion can take.

    So requiring every excluded path to exist -- which this test used to do
    -- makes the published tree carry the very documents it excludes.  It
    did exactly that: the assembled public tree drops `docs/LANE-BRIEFING.md`
    on purpose, and this assertion then failed on both CI matrix legs, on the
    release commit, with `ci.yml` firing on push
    (`evidence/xmachine-20260827/`, `evidence/assembly-rehearsal-20260827/`).

    What replaces it for the exclusions is an OUTCOME check, below: the thing
    that must not travel is asserted absent from the real packed set, whether
    it is absent because it was excluded or because it is not in the tree at

    THE INVARIANT IS THE OUTCOME, not the mechanism, and that distinction is

    EXISTS -- so that an exclusion protecting nothing could not read as a
    pass -- and the published tree, which deliberately does not carry the
    briefing at all, then failed its own packaging gate on both CI matrix
